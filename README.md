# VRanner
Monitoring and optimizing building process

# Abstract

Even the most prestigious construction projects run out of planned budget & time. That's because nobody can predict all future project' details for planning. Construction process and its front edge part; Building Information Modeling (BIM), needs improvement as technology is moving forward fast. And we would like to work on it's least noticed aspect: planning. That's where VRanner can be a great help.

VRanner stands for VR and Planner. Not only it combines BIM with VR, but also improves the planning phase. Before anything being constructed, VRanner put decision makers into real-life experience of future stages in a game-like format. This helps them to notify future problems & difficulties that they will encounter, if they don't prevent them from the beginning.

To develop VRanner, our most effort went into implementation of BIM model with Unity (along with C#). Then we customized Unity assets to simulate construction phases of a our model. Meanwhile, we equipped it with teleportation. This feature eases navigation inside large site-works.

Combination of BIM-based planning and VR opens many new opportunities for further work, each can improve different aspect of building process: improving profit-margin, planning, and safety during the work.

# More info

By VRanner, decision makers can see how the project will look be at different stages, so from the beginning, they can monitor the project from different (technical) viewpoints. This help them to plan better for procurement, logistic, implementation, safety of workers, etc. One of the main advantages of VRanner is that, is gamified and this turns the boring & frustrating planning phase into an exciting game.

Meanwhile, along with this file you should be able to download a folder, which is simplified version of our VRanner for a small building. For developing VRanner, we used Tekla Structures and Unity (along with C#), but other softwares can be used too.

# Final Word

This project is just a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that we developed to bring up this whole idea. Ofcourse, there are certainly many ways for improvemnet.
